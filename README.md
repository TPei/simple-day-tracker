simple-day-tracker
==================

Add occurences to keep track of special dates. Visualize them using days in year, weeks in year or weekdays

simply run the add_occurence.py program to add the week, day and weekday of an occurence
whenever you want a graph created run the visualize_days.py, visualize_weeks.py visualize_weekdays.py file

for each date the week in year will be added to the weektracker.txt
for each date the day in year will be added to daytracker.txt
for each date the day of the week will be added to weekdaytracker.txt

note that entering wrong values corrupts the tracking file
while entering an invalid date simply crashes the add_occurence.py file,
entering a valid date from another year corrupts the data
you can however simply open the stracker.txt file and remove the last entry
(make sure you sustain the empty line at the end of the program)

examples for thins you could track:
weeks/days in which:
 you were very (un)productive
 you spent more money than you wanted
 you met with someone or someone from a group of certain people
